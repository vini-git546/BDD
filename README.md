## BDD = Cucumber-jvm + java + selenium

This is a template application that allows you to start using cucumber-jvm with Java and Selenium to use BDD process in your project.
In the docs folder there is a presentation I made explaining the BDD concepts and the examples you're going to find in this project.
You can run the examples withing Eclipse by using JUnit. Just right-click in the JUnit class, then click Run As -> JUnit Test.
