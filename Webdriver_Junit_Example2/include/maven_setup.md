Java and Maven Setup
---

You will need to use JDK 1.6 (or higher) and Maven 2.2.1 (or higher) in order to complete this tutorial.

Download and install [Java](http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp) if it isn't already installed on your system.

Go to the [Maven download](http://maven.apache.org/download.html) page to download the Maven binary distribution and extract it to your file system.  Add the `bin` directory to your path, for example,

<!-- SAUCE:BEGIN_PLATFORM:MAC|LINUX -->
```bash
export PATH=YOUR_MAVEN_PATH/bin:$PATH
```
<!-- SAUCE:END_PLATFORM -->

<!-- SAUCE:BEGIN_PLATFORM:WIN -->
```bash
set PATH=YOUR_MAVEN_PATH/bin:%PATH%
```
<!-- SAUCE:END_PLATFORM -->
