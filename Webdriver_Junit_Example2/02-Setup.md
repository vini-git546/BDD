Setting Up Java and Maven for Sauce
=====

We suggest that you consider using [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) to build your Java project and either the 
[JUnit](http://www.junit.org) or the [TestNG](http://www.testng.org) library to write Selenium tests. While neither 
Maven, JUnit nor TestNG are required to write Java tests for Sauce, this is the framework that we'll use for this 
tutorial.

Although this tutorial is not a comprehensive guide for getting Java and Maven set up on
your system, here are some guidelines:

<!-- SAUCE:INCLUDE:maven_setup -->

You're all set up!
