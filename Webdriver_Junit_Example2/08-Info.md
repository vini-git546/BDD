Manual Testing
---
This tutorial discussed automated testing. However, sometimes it's useful to manually run a test on a version 
of a browser that you don't have on your system so you can quickly troubleshoot a pesky issue. 
For that we have Sauce Labs manual testing:

*   [Try manual testing](https://saucelabs.com/docs/manual)
*   Download [Sauce for Mac](http://saucelabs.com/downloads/Sauce-for-Mac-BETA.dmg),
    the native Mac app for manual testing
